//        Why Use join()?
//                Thread Synchronization: It ensures proper synchronization between threads. Without join(), you can't guarantee that all threads will finish their tasks before the program moves on, especially when the main thread depends on their results.
//
//        Preventing Premature Program Exit: If the main thread finishes executing before the child threads, the child threads may not have finished their tasks, leading to incomplete results.
//
//                Coordinating Concurrent Tasks: join() allows you to coordinate the termination of multiple threads in a way that ensures proper sequencing of tasks.
//
//        The join() method is used to make the main thread (or any other thread) wait until the threads it is waiting for have finished their execution. Essentially, it ensures that the main thread does not proceed until all child threads have completed their tasks.
//
//        How join() Works:
//        When you call join() on a thread, the calling thread (in this case, the main thread) will pause and wait for the thread on which join() was called to finish executing.
//
//                The main thread is calling join() on each of the 5 threads, which ensures that the main thread will only print the final value of the counter after all the threads have finished their work.


//
//        Yes, if multiple threads try to access and modify the same shared resource
//        (variable, file, database record, etc.) without proper synchronization, it can lead to a race
//    condition.

//        The join() method in Java threads is crucial for coordinating thread execution and

//
//        Key Reasons for Using join()
//        Ensures Completion Before Proceeding
//
//        Makes the calling thread (usually main) wait until the joined thread finishes execution
//
//        Without join(), main might print the counter value before all threads complete
//
//        Prevents Race Conditions
//
//        In your example, multiple threads are incrementing AsyncThreadPrac.counter
//
//        join() guarantees all increments are done before reading the final value
